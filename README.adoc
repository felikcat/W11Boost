== What's different about this compared to other optimizers / debloaters?
. The number one focus of breaking nothing.
. Being very easy to use, and requiring no reading of instructions.
. (WORK IN PROGRESS) Changes can be rolled back without a system restore point or any other form of backups.
. Specific use cases are covered, such as fully installing .appx and WinGet support on Windows LTSC builds.
. (WORK IN PROGRESS) Changes are by a per user basis.
. No false claims that this will boost performance in video games. It is only to improve the responsiveness and usability of the Windows operating system, to make it feel better than it was prior.
- However, it can greatly boost virtualized environments such as VirtualBox and VMWare if you turn off Virtualization Based Security.
. Written in the Rust programming language. In the past W11Boost used Batch, then PowerShell, then C, then C++; Rust made it easier to spot problems, and made W11Boost more robust. Rust's safety makes it easy to write quality applications, even if you're bad at using Rust.

== Recommendations

. Install https://winaerotweaker.com/[Winaero Tweaker] to set personal preferences.

. Download https://github.com/beatcracker/toptout/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[toptout] and open PowerShell as administrator:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- `.\topout_directory\examples\toptout_pwsh.ps1 -Env -Exec`
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`

. If you wish to reduce the amount of network traffic to and from Microsoft, use https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall[simplewall].

=== Backups
Use https://www.urbackup.org[UrBackup]. You will need another computer to store backups on, but this will end up costing less long-term than services such as Backblaze, plus you completely own your data. 

Optionally, you can also use https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal[Backblaze] for extra redundancy in case of sudden natural disasters, or other situations where you cannot move your backups into a safe location in time.

=== CPU
. Install https://bitsum.com/download-process-lasso/[Process Lasso] and use `Active Power Profile -> Bitsum Highest Performance` profile. +
Setting this power profile is not recommended for laptops, however there are other benefits to using Process Lasso.
- This will destroy power savings for little gain, determine whether that trade-off is worth it, especially if paying for electricity.

. Check if the default process priority located in "Performance Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Processor scheduling" is set to "Programs". You can search "performance of Windows" in the Start Menu to locate where to open "Performance Options".
. Ensure Game Mode is on.
- Also: Optimizations for windowed games.

=== GPU
. To enable https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards; which makes Borderless Windowed the same speed as Fullscreen:
- Set your display's "Output color depth" to 8bpc.
image:nvcplui_1.png[]
- Do not use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

=== Windows
. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.

. If you're okay with installing more software:
- Install https://www.startallback.com/[StartAllBack] to speed up Windows 11, and also restore old interface elements from Windows 7 or 10.
- Install https://github.com/Xanashi/Icaros[Icaros] for better and faster image & video thumbnails.

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Third-party anti-malware programs provide better protection, most notably ESET or BitDefender, but may have flaws such as slowing down your internet speeds. Be sure to test before and after.

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

Note that Intel 2.5Gbit adapters may not work for your motherboard, such is the case for Gigabyte AMD X870E motherboards.

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.

=== (Not recommended) Using fullscreen exclusive in games
Lowers input delay and GPU usage; potentially higher FPS, depending on the game.

.Drawbacks:
. Much higher time to switch between the game and another app (Alt + Tab).
. Increases chances of crashing games.

.How to:
. Unity engine; use the launch option: `-window-mode exclusive`
