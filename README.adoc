W11Boost globally changes settings. It's not meant for shared computers. Despite this, the default checkbox selection is safe for most users as it is as close to stock unmodified Windows as possible without being ineffective.

.Features that stick out:
- All changes are easily revertable through the Group Policy Editor.
** To quickly remove all changes by W11Boost, delete `C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Registry.pol` and `C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\User\Registry.pol`, then reboot.
- A focus on being non-intrusive. For example, we don't disable syncing to a Microsoft account, instead we suggest an alternative if that is desired.

- "Disable Defender and Smartscreen" being a replacement for Sordum's Defender Control v2.1, the prior best tool for the job.

- Optional anti-forensics.

- A way to disable sleep and hibernation fully for specific use cases.

- Windows Store and WinGet installers, aimed towards LTSC builds that lack both by default.

- Written in Rust instead of PowerShell or Batch, meaning it is more predictable and robust.

== 1. If not using Enterprise or LTSC or Education, convert the Windows edition to Education

. Open the Command Prompt as administrator.
. `cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /upk`
. `changepk.exe /ProductKey YNMGQ-8RYV3-4PGQ3-C8XTP-7CFBY`
. Use https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts?tab=readme-ov-file#method-1---powershell-windows-8-and-later-%EF%B8%8F[MAS] or https://github.com/abbodi1406/KMS_VL_ALL_AIO/releases[KMS_VL_ALL_AIO] to activate Windows by installing its auto-renewal.
- To open a .7z archive on Windows, you need https://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip].

== 2. Installing W11Boost

. Install the latest https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe[Visual Studio Redistributable].

. Download and run the https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost/releases[latest release of W11Boost].

. W11Boost usage: 
- Only Windows 10 version 1803 and newer are officially supported.
- The near guarantee of breaking no program or app is only for the default selection of checkboxes.

- "Reduce local data collection" won't change how you use Windows.

- Installing the Microsoft Store and .appx support is generally for LTSC builds of Windows, but works on any edition regardless.

- "Reduce online data collection" will change how you use Windows.

- "Disable Virtualization Based Security" is meant to boost FPS in games and especially make VMs (VirtualBox & VMWare) run faster.

. If you wish to reduce the amount of network traffic to and from Microsoft, use https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall[simplewall].

. Install https://winaerotweaker.com/[Winaero Tweaker] to set personal preferences.

. Download https://github.com/beatcracker/toptout/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[toptout] and open PowerShell as administrator:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- `.\topout_directory\examples\toptout_pwsh.ps1 -Env -Exec`
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`

== 3. Recommendations

=== Backups
Use https://www.urbackup.org[UrBackup]. You will need another computer to store backups on, but this will end up costing less long-term than services such as Backblaze, plus you completely own your data. 

Optionally, you can also use https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal[Backblaze] for extra redundancy in case of sudden natural disasters, or other situations where you cannot move your backups into a safe location in time.

=== CPU
. Install https://bitsum.com/download-process-lasso/[Process Lasso] and use `Active Power Profile -> Bitsum Highest Performance` profile. +
Setting this power profile is not recommended for laptops, however there are other benefits to using Process Lasso.
- This will destroy power savings for little gain, determine whether that trade-off is worth it, especially if paying for electricity.

. Check if the default process priority located in "Performance Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Processor scheduling" is set to "Programs". You can search "performance of Windows" in the Start Menu to locate where to open "Performance Options".
. Ensure Game Mode is on.
- Also: Optimizations for windowed games.

=== GPU
. To enable https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards; which makes Borderless Windowed the same speed as Fullscreen:
- Set your display's "Output color depth" to 8bpc.
image:nvcplui_1.png[]
- Do not use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

=== Windows
. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.

. If you're okay with installing more software:
- Install https://www.startallback.com/[StartAllBack] to speed up Windows 11, and also restore old interface elements from Windows 7 or 10.
- Install https://github.com/Xanashi/Icaros[Icaros] for better and faster image & video thumbnails.

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Third-party anti-malware programs provide better protection, most notably ESET or BitDefender, but may have flaws such as slowing down your internet speeds. Be sure to test before and after.

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

Note that Intel 2.5Gbit adapters may not work for your motherboard, such is the case for Gigabyte AMD X870E motherboards.

.Buying an Intel i225-V PCIe card
====
The Intel i225-V PCIe card tested is https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100410590[IOCrest's variant], which works well our 6700k and 12700k PCs.

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.

=== (Not recommended) Using fullscreen exclusive in games
Lowers input delay and GPU usage; potentially higher FPS, depending on the game.

.Drawbacks:
. Much higher time to switch between the game and another app (Alt + Tab).
. Increases chances of crashing games.

.How to:
. Unity engine; use the launch option: `-window-mode exclusive`
