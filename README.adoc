== W11Boost compared to other optimizers & debloaters
. Comprehensive third-party program telemetry disabling; 202 environment variables set to do so, and a few registry tweaks.

. Has a fleshed out anti-forensics feature. This is meant for people running invasive programs they don't trust with their privacy, such as anti-cheats.

. Insanely light-weight; only 320KB in file size.

. Can be fully uninstalled without resorting to: system restore, backups, or reinstalling Windows.

. The number one focus of breaking nothing by default.

. Very easy to use.

I recommend checking "Minimize Microsoft online data" if you don't care if the way you use Windows is changed, it makes Windows less bloated.


== Additional recommendations

=== Windows
NOTE: Third-party anti-malware programs can provide better protection, but can seriously screw up your Windows installation, as Kaspersky would even after uninstalling it.

. Install the following: 
- https://winaerotweaker.com/[Winaero Tweaker] to set personal preferences.
- https://www.startallback.com/[StartAllBack] to speed up Windows 11, and also restore old interface elements from Windows 7 or 10.
- https://github.com/Xanashi/Icaros[Icaros] for better and faster image & video thumbnails. Be sure to activate "Thumbnailing", "Properties", and "Cache" (use Dynamic) in IcarosConfig. You can set the locations for "Cache" to all your disks/drives and build the cache for them in advance.
- https://github.com/tnodir/fort[Fort Firewall] to reduce the amount of network traffic to and from Microsoft or other software.

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.


=== Backups
Use https://www.veeam.com/send_license/backup-agent-windows-free/[Veeam Agent]. An alternative is https://www.urbackup.org[UrBackup]; downside is that it doesn't allow you to restore your PC to a previous state, and you will need another computer to store backups on. Veeam Agent or UrBackup will end up costing less long-term than services such as Backblaze, and you completely own your data.

Optionally, you can also use https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal[Backblaze] for extra redundancy in case of sudden natural disasters, or other situations where you cannot move your backups into a safe location in time.

=== CPU
. Install https://bitsum.com/download-process-lasso/[Process Lasso] and use `Active Power Profile -> Bitsum Highest Performance` profile. +
Setting this power profile is not recommended for laptops, however there are other benefits to using Process Lasso.
- This will destroy power savings for little gain, determine whether that trade-off is worth it, especially if paying for electricity.

. Check if the default process priority located in "Performance Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Processor scheduling" is set to "Programs". You can search "performance of Windows" in the Start Menu to locate where to open "Performance Options".
. Ensure Game Mode is on.
- Also: Optimizations for windowed games.

=== GPU
. To enable https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards; which makes Borderless Windowed the same speed as Fullscreen:
- Set your display's "Output color depth" to 8bpc.
image:nvcplui_1.png[]
- Do not use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

Note that Intel 2.5Gbit adapters may not work for your motherboard, such is the case for Gigabyte AMD X870E motherboards.

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.

=== (Not recommended) Using fullscreen exclusive in games
Lowers input delay and GPU usage; potentially higher FPS, depending on the game.

.Drawbacks:
. Much higher time to switch between the game and another app (Alt + Tab).
. Increases chances of crashing games.

.How to:
. Unity engine; use the launch option: `-window-mode exclusive`
