NOTE: This project uses AI written code, version 1.6.2 is the last version without AI use. +
I think it's much better than prior releases, but ultimately it's up to you to decide on whether to use it.

== How to use
Run W11Boost in a virtual machine first, I'd recommend https://www.techspot.com/downloads/189-vmware-workstation-for-windows.html[VMWare Workstation] for running VMs on Windows.

Doing this in a virtual machine is recommended to get a feel for what you want to do without risking your main system, and to make it easier to compare before and after in terms of RAM and CPU usage among other metrics. There is a complete uninstaller, but it fully reverts to Windows defaults for each option selected.

Go to the https://github.com/felikcat/W11Boost/releases[latest releases] and download W11Boost, run it, pick out what options you want.

.Notes
- The default settings are what's recommended, beyond that is personal preference.
- This is intended ONLY for personal use and not for corporate environments; no CLI automation will be provided.

== Additional recommendations

=== Windows
NOTE: Third-party anti-malware programs can provide better protection, but can seriously screw up your Windows installation, as Kaspersky would even after uninstalling it.

. Install the following: 

- If you have an AMD CPU, grab the https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html[latest chipset drivers] for it.
** For Intel CPUs, https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005533/software/chipset-software.html[go here].

. Replace Consumer OEM apps with their Enterprise variant. Such as replacing Lenovo Vantage with Lenovo Commercial Vantage.

. Keep the number of apps installed to a minimum, and remove unused apps. This reduces your chances of being impacted by https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-compromise-3cx-desktop-app-in-a-supply-chain-attack/[supply chain attacks], prevents causing Windows more issues, and might improve FPS stability.


=== Backups
Use https://www.veeam.com/send_license/backup-agent-windows-free/[Veeam Agent]. An alternative is https://www.urbackup.org[UrBackup]; downside is that it doesn't allow you to restore your PC to a previous state, and you will need another computer to store backups on. Veeam Agent or UrBackup will end up costing less long-term than services such as Backblaze, and you completely own your data.

Optionally, you can also use https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal[Backblaze] for extra redundancy in case of sudden natural disasters, or other situations where you cannot move your backups into a safe location in time.

=== GPU
. Use https://kernel.org/doc/html/next/gpu/amdgpu/display/mpo-overview.html[Multiplane Overlay] on NVIDIA cards; which makes Borderless Windowed the same speed as Fullscreen. Do note however that these conditions must be met:
- The display's "Output color depth" has to be 8bpc:

- You cannot use: custom resolutions, DSR, or scaling.

=== BIOS
* *Enable the following:*
. I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
. Above 4G Decoding and Resizable BAR.
** On ASRock motherboards: C.A.M. (Clever Access Memory)
. HPET (High Precision Event Timer)

=== Ethernet
Avoid Realtek 2.5Gbit adapters, as they are much more CPU intensive than Intel 2.5Gbit adapters.

Note that Intel 2.5Gbit adapters may not work for your motherboard, such is the case for Gigabyte AMD X870E motherboards.

.Buying an Intel i225-V PCIe card
====
The Intel i225-V PCIe card tested is https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100410590[IOCrest's variant], which works well our 6700k and 12700k PCs.

I have not tested https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101345677/search?SearchText=i226[DERAPID's Intel i226-V PCIe cards], which are similarly priced and rate well.
